A Sudoku generator, solver and game written in JavaScript (ES6). It is based on Peter Norvig's [Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html). You can read about the algorithms and access the original Python implementation from that link.

Currently the game only has one level and it's very hard. You can [play it here](https://tshrestha.github.io/js-sudoku/app/).
